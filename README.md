TimePact is designed to be an app to boost user efficiency and productivity. By allowing the user to select x 
amount of apps, the user will be put into a pact such that those are the only apps they can open for x amount
of time. In essence, users are forced to do their work and are not able to stray or open other websites, 
forcing them to be on task. Coupled with this will be an honor code system, consisting of self-evaluation 
checks and intermittent worklogs within the duration that TimePact is active. In addition to this,
it will store and record data to provide the user with information on their productivity and efficiency. 

Currently, TimePact is in its prototyping and development stage such that we hope to deploy our first full 
official version into the real world on March 1st: 3/1/2026.
